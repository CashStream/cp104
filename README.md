# Laurier-CP104

# Description
This repository is meant to guide you through the labs and assignments for the Laurier CP104 course.

This is not to be copied but to use for general help, if you get stuck

# Rules I try to follow
I try to do my best to explain the code and provide helpful tips and tricks.
        Such as:
            1. Providing an easier way to install Eclipse/pydev 
            2. Include helpful resources where applicable 
                # To view all resources use the resources folder

I try to make sure that the code is pep-8 compliant
    exceptions:
        1. Docstrings (as they need to use the CP104 docstring conventions)
        2. Any non-python files (Such as this file)

    # To learn more about pep-8 visit link 1 or 2 provided below
        1. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        2. https://pep8.org/

I initialize all variables at the top of the module/file or at the top of the function for readability

I try to make sure not to include any variables in the global scope that do not need to be global

I try to enforce data types for variables and returns for functions

# Final Thoughts
Best of Luck in your courses.
Have Fun!
